    <Name>Hocico</Name>
    <Description>
      The Mexican group Hocico was officially formed in 1993 by Erk Aicrag (lyrics and vocals) and Racso Agroyam (synthesizer, programming).
      The names are ananyms of the real names Erik Garcia and Oscar Mayorga.
      Both cousins had been experimenting with electronic music, mixing Industrial and EBM, since they were fifteen years old and formed a band in 1992 called Hocico de Perro.
      The first live gig of Hocico was on February 18, 1994. Their music can be described as dark and aggressive electro-industrial. Their lyrics are mostly English although some songs are in Spanish.
      After being active for 27 years in the underground scene Hocico has become one of the most influential bands of the harder electronic music genre.
      Hocico is one of the most active bands in the underground music scene, both live and in the studio. They have released 9 albums, a hanfdul of live DVDâ€™s and countless singles to date.
      The Spanish word 'hocico' means snout and is a derogatory term that indicates ugliness (i.e., ugly as a dog's snout).
      Agroyam has a side project called Dulce Liquido, while Aicrag has one called Rabia Sorda.
